Create YOUR OWN version of Repo —> (Fork)


Your name should now be in front of the repo name before the slash '/' if forking is successful
Clone your Repo using githubs 'Clone or download' button
Back inside your CLI, use the cd command to go to the directory where you are going to want to clone your forked Repo (i.e. The location where the repo should be saved on your computer)
Use the git clone <link-to-repo> command to clone the repo to the directory you are currently in.
cd into the newly created repo using the cd <repo-name> command
Use the git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname' command to create your own branch name for the repo (this is the branch that you will be doing your work on)
Add and commit changes on your branch.
Push your changes back up to your Github repo
Go back to your forked Project repo on github (make sure you are on YOUR FORKED copy NOT the original Lambda one).
